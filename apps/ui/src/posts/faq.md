## What is the purpose of this project?

This project seeks to answer 2 questions for people:

1. Did polygamy exist in our families?
2. What did plural families look like during that time?

These questions are hard to answer, and the tool is highly dependent on family research conducted previously. It does
however, identify polygamous relationships, assuming dates for births, deaths, marriages, and divorces are accurate.
Polygamy is such an uncommon thing for people these days, that it's hard to conceptualize what was like to have a
household with multiple mothers/wives and how the shape of that family progressed over time.

## where to source my family tree?

This is a tricky question. I would recommend familySearch because members of the LDS Church have been diligent at
documenting these plural families. However, you cannot export your tree for this tool to read. The workaround is to
export it to ancestry.com and then download the tree as a gedcom file. Note that you will only get the first 4
generations into ancestry. So you may need to review some of their hints.

## I'm lost about polygamy and why we want to know about families in the Mormonism movement

There's a lot to unpack here. Joseph Smith was leader of the Mormonism movement, or popularly known as the founder of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church, aka the Mormons). He started the church in 1830 and within a
few years, introduced the concept of polygamy as a required institution for salvation in heavenâ€“specifically that a man
should have multiple wives. There is definitely more to it than that, and I am generalizing it quite a bit, but the
takeaway is that the Mormon people had to reconcile their entire lives with this practice, so many families adopted the
practice. So to put it simply, many Mormon families had one husband and multiple wives.

## Are you against polygamy?

This is hard to answer. I do not practice it or know anyone personally who does. I am just seeking to understand my
family history around it and offer the opportunity to others. Women are equal to men, and I condemn ideologies and
practices to the contrary.

## Who is your audience then?

I think Mormon Polygamy has been a fascination of the country for a long, long time. I hope everyone feels comfortable
using this tool, from members of the LDS Church, to plural-family fundamentalists, to Mormon history aficionados.

## I am offended by your project

I'm treading pretty carefully here, so I apologize if my amateur historicity isn't up to par. I am trying to stay
neutral on such an interesting and provoking topic, so help me out if I am not meeting my goal. People should be able to
understand this part of Mormon (an American) culture in the full light of day.

## How do timelines reveal what life was like for plural families?

Timelines help depict the shape of these families over time, like when there were concurrent wives, how many men
practiced, if there were prior or subsequent marriages, if children resulted from all marriages, and the age gaps
between husbands, wives, and step-families.

## Have you found anything noteworthy using these timelines?

-   Most polygamous men had 3 wives.
-   Of my male mormon ancestors who were eligible to practice polygamy, 40% did practice it.
-   Not all women stayed with their polygamous husband until their deaths. This has led me to journals and family
    stories about how this practice challenged the women who participated. This has been a very fascinating aspect to
    this project
