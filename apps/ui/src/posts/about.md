# Me

I am a Utah "native," with pioneer ancestors 6 generations back in almost all my lines. Some ancestors have had books
published about their lives, for better and for worse. Of course, these topics get controversial very quickly, but for
me, I have never felt connected to the bad (nor the good) actions of my ancestors. I've got my own life to live.
Nonetheless, society in Utah was remarkably different 150 years ago, and I have a wealth of firsthand accounts at my
disposal. It's beginning to paint quite the picture.

# My Experience

As clich√© as it sounds, this project has drawn me closer towards my family history to understand my ancestors better.
Family life dictates so much of our lives, such as our well-being, our goals, and our livelihoods. In their case, family
life was dictated by their new, insular society, including the responsibilities of each member, the goals of the
household, and even the shape of the family itself. This project has highlighted families to look into. One of the wives
I read about fled, not being able to stand up to the pressures of that new life. Another set ostracized the youngest
sister wife, quite literally, convincing the husband to place her alone with her children in a poorly constructed home
far from town. Another brought home a new sister wife, who he introduced to the other wives only after conducting the
new marriage. Nonetheless, most of these families thrived and prospered, creating the rich heritage that I am a part of.

Writing this all off as "it was a different time back then" is quite ignorant of the lives these people lived. They
faced real decisions, and especially on the Frontier, real consequences. While they did not have the tools, laws, and
connections that we have today, they still had the same desires, instincts, and intuitions. The mirror may be tarnished
from the dust of the changing times, but behind all that, the reflection of our true nature cuts through.
